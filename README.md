## 彡 Before you interact! ⋆｡°✩
<p align="center">
I am a multishipper which means I ship multiple ships with one character / few characters, I do not mind MOST ships as long ast they aren't morally or legally wrong! I'm OK with people hiding behind me, or cuddling with me, just because someone as Shadow Milk Cookie sits with me as Pure Vanilla Cookie, doesn't mean that I ship ShadowVanilla! I'm multifandom, but my current hyperfixation is Cookie Run at the moment, so expect me to hang arount the CRK / FNAF / HS area in safe server, or near bakery in 18+ server! I'm neurodivergent, I use tone indicators and need them to understand other person's tone sometimes! I can be spiteful and very much a menace to people who annoy me!

## 彡 Do NOT interact! ⋆｡°✩
<p align="center">
Racist, Pedophile / Lolishotacon / MAP / NOMAP, Minors (18+ server only, ok to interact in safe server), Zionists (or at least don't identify as Anti-Zionist), Pro-life, Anti-LGBTQ (including: 'LGB without T', 'A in LGBTQIA is for ally', 'Aro/Ace people are not a part of LGBT community', 'You need to be atheist to support LGBT', Against xenogenders, Against neopronouns), Zoophile / Zoosexual, Proshipper / Profiction / Comship / Darkship / Problematic 'Dead Dove: do not eat' (putting those together cuz the community had watered down their own terms so badly i cannot trust anyone using any of those labels, when I say that I dont care for most ships or that its okay to explore darker themes, please do not incluse me in as a 'proshipper', being all against harassment for harmless ships should be common sense and most basic info to know, as well as exploring dark themes and painting them as bad is much different than depicting it in a manner that seems romanticized or fetishized, thanks a lot)!
